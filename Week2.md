# Week 2

### Carlos Gonzalez

This week I learned how to use react native a bit more and was able to do create a card like thing that looks like the one from tinder. This took a bit of time especially with my little to none knowledge of react native and java script. A lot still needs to be changed such as the picture not being properly in frame. I was able to run it on an iPhone simulator. I am still new to all this so I am not exactly sure how the next steps will work. I did not merge it to master because I am bit confused on how the screen works but I think this a good starting point especially for not knowing react native.

### Yaki Lebovits

This week I created the overall project structure for the backend application. I also created the database table and related model to store user data.

### Ryan Hardison

This week we all agreed that a conversion to Expo Cli would greatly ease the testing process for running the mobile app. So I worked on the conversion from React Cli to Expo Cli and were able to successfully get Expo working. I also started but did not yet get to finish working on some front-end login page UI changes to get a proper login page created for the app.
