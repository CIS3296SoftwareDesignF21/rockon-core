# Week 4

### Bryan Oberholtzer



### Yaki Lebovits

This week I worked on finishing several backend features, such as user swiping and login. I also converted the application from relying on relational DBs (Apache Hibernate and MySQL) to using graph-base DB (Neo4j). I also configured the deployment the application to Google AppEngine.

### Carlos Gonzalez

This week I created a simple editing profile screen for the sake of time. I also created a matches screen. Finished and debugged the animations needed for the card. I refacted the three parts and made them into their screen and attempted to create a navigation button that would allow the screens to change without hardcoding it at every attempt.

### Ryan Hardison

I created functionaility for making a new account within the front-end of our applicaiton. This enables the user to enter all designated information about themselves needed for storing them within the database. I also formatted the user inputted data into JSON which is then readable by the back-end for storing.

###Bryan Oberholtzer
This week I worked on creating a method of navigating between the app pages that different members created. I used the react-navigation
library along with online references to create a basic demo of page switching on button presses. The integration of the app pages
was largely unsuccessful as react native has many way to display a page, and the group's general lack of experience with react-native
meant we were unable to resolve the conflict this created. To demo, I created an account creation page that takes field input then
sends a POST request to the back end hosted online. As of the demo, backend communication is nonfunctional.
