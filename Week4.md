# Week 4

### Bryan Oberholtzer



### Yaki Lebovits

This week I worked on finishing several backend features, such as user swiping and login. I also converted the application from relying on relational DBs (Apache Hibernate and MySQL) to using graph-base DB (Neo4j). I also configured the deployment the application to Google AppEngine.
