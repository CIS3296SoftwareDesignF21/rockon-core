# Week 3

### Bryan Oberholtzer

Overwrite expo repo for App.js main files instead of typescript
Have App.js make HTTP GET request from core repo for list of database users, and display that on the screen

### Yaki Lebovits

This week I implemented the CRUD functionality for managing users. I also implemented the backend swiping feature, and started work in deploying the backend to GCP.

### Carlos Gonzalez

This week because of exams I had on Thursday the 11th and Monday the 15. I was still able to work on the overall layout of the app but still have yet to merge everything to the master branch because of the overhaul that was done recently. I also worked on creating the swiping feature and started working on a button that will allow the user to either choose if they would potentially want to rock climb with someone or not.

### Ryan Hardison
Helped with the overhaul of repo from React Native CLI to Expo. This allows us to have an easier time when actually trying to simulate the lab since we can scan the QR code and have the app show up on our phone. He also worked on creating a login screen using different components from react native. As of now since the front end and back end are not connected the login screen is currently just a login screen.
